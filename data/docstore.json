A lower credit score than 580 doesn’t necessarily exclude you from FHA loan eligibility if you have a minimum down payment of 10%.\nThere are other requirements for FHA loans in addition to credit score and certain down payment amount. Here is the complete list of FHA loan requirements, which are set by the Federal Housing Administration:\n\n### 1) Steady Employment History\nBorrowers must be able to demonstrate a steady employment history or have been working for the same employer for the past two years.\n\n### 2) Social Security Number\nBorrowers must have a valid social security number, lawfully reside in the U.S. and be of legal age to sign a mortgage in their respective state at the time of application.\n\n### 3) Down-Payment\nBorrowers must put a minimum down payment of 3.5%, which can be gifted by a family member.","metadata":{"source":"./data/limits2023.md"}}],["1",{"pageContent":"### 3) Down-Payment\nBorrowers must put a minimum down payment of 3.5%, which can be gifted by a family member.\n\n### 4) Owner-Occupied Residence\nNew FHA loans are only available for primary residence occupancy. You must live in the home as your primary residence after purchase. FHA loans are designed to encourage home-ownership. The owner-occupancy requirement prevents investors from buying the homes and renting them out.\n\n### 5) Property Appraisal\nBorrowers are required to have a property appraisal from a FHA-approved appraiser. The property must meet certain minimum standards at appraisal. If the home you want to purchase does not meet these standards and a seller will not agree to the required repairs, your only option is to pay for the required repairs at closing (to be held in escrow until the repairs are complete).","metadata":{"source":"./data/limits2023.md"}}],["2",{"pageContent":"### 6) Front-End Ratio\nBorrowers are generally required to have a front-end ratio (mortgage payment plus HOA fees, property taxes, mortgage insurance, homeowners insurance) of less than 31% of their gross income. Sometimes, you may be approved with as high a percentage as 40% but your lender will be required to provide justification as to why they believe the mortgage presents an acceptable risk. The lender must then include any compensating factors used for loan approval.\n\n### 7) Back-End Ratio\nBorrowers are required to have a back-end ratio (mortgage plus all your monthly debt, i.e., credit card payment, car payment, student loans, etc.) of less than 43% of their gross income. Sometimes, you may be approved with as high a percentage as 50% but your lender will be required to provide justification as to why they believe the mortgage presents an acceptable risk.

FHA-qualified lenders determine on a case-by-case basis an applicants’ credit worthiness.\n\n### 9) Bankruptcy\nBorrowers must be two years out of bankruptcy and have re-established good credit.

Some exceptions can be made if there were extenuating circumstances and you’ve improved your credit. Not being able to sell your home because you had to move to a new area does not qualify as an exception to the three-year foreclosure guideline.\n\n### 11) Loan Limits\nThe Federal Housing Administration is the one that sets maximum mortgage limits for FHA loans that vary by state and county. Loan limits range from $275,665 to $721,050 for a 1 living-unit property depending upon where you are buying a home.\n\n```\nDate: December 1, 2022\n\nMortgagee Letter 2022 - 20","metadata":{"source":"./data/limits2023.md"}}],["5",{"pageContent":"```\nDate: December 1, 2022\n\nMortgagee Letter 2022 - 20\n\nTo: All FHA-Approved MortgageesAll Direct Endorsement UnderwritersAll Eligible Submission Sources for Condominium Project ApprovalsAll FHA Roster AppraisersAll FHA-Approved 203(k) ConsultantsAll HUD-Approved Housing CounselorsAll HUD-Approved Nonprofit OrganizationsAll Governmental Entity ParticipantsAll Real Estate BrokersAll Closing Agents\n\n\nSubject\n2023 Nationwide Forward Mortgage Loan Limits\n\nPurpose\nThis Mortgagee Letter (ML) establishes the 2023 Nationwide Forward\nMortgage Loan Limits.\n\nEffective Date The provisions of this ML are effective for case numbers assigned on or\nafter January 1, 2023.\n\nAll updates will be incorporated into a forthcoming update of the HUD\nHandbook 4000.1, FHA Single Family Housing Policy Handbook\n(Handbook 4000.1).","metadata":{"source":"./data/limits2023.md"}}],["6",{"pageContent":"All updates will be incorporated into a forthcoming update of the HUD\nHandbook 4000.1, FHA Single Family Housing Policy Handbook\n(Handbook 4000.1).\n\nPublic Feedback HUD welcomes feedback from interested parties for a period of 30 calendar\ndays from the date of issuance.
